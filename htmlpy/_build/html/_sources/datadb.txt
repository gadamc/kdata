KDataPy DataDB Functions
=================================

This is a special set of database tools that interacts directly with the 'datadb' database. It specifically gives
you an easy way to call some of the server-side database functions. 

**Warning: Only use this if you really know what you're doing since these functions will modify important parts of the 
documents found in the 'datadb' database.**
