create bandpass database documents
===================================

This is still in development (sorta... manpower issues has slowed it down.) The idea is that this will help a user to upload a bandpass filter document to the database for use in automated analysis routines that are planned to be implemented. Contact adam.cox@kit.edu if you want to work on this.
