# Libraries built by the kds module

KDS_LIB    := $(LPATH)/libkds.$(SOEXT)  

#NOTE: this really should be libkds ! But we call it libKData for now for historical reasons.
# this could easily be changed, but then so would the documentation and anybody's code that is using
# it. Maybe this will be a change in version 3. 
# we're already on 'version 3' because of the dropping of the "Sub" in the SubRecord names.
