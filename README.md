# KData

KData is a data structure and analysis platform for the EDELWEISS direct dark matter search experiment. The data structure
is based on CERN's ROOT framework. It allows for the combination of an arbitrary number of simultaneous events occurring
in any subset of Germanium bolometers and the muon-veto rejection system. The analysis tools include signal processing,
calibration routines, and features to filter out relevant types of events into smaller subsets.

for more information.
